## Abstract
This is one of our Pair Projects during our time at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/). We created a recipe tracking application that allows users to view and favorite recipes. Users can also search for recipes by type, name, or ingredient. Finally, users can determine what recipes they could cook based on selected ingredients from their pantry.
